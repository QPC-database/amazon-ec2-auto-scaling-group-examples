# Auto Scaling Group Lifecycle Hooks Example - User Data Managed Windows Multi Reboot

This example solution deploys an Auto Scaling group within a VPC. A lifecycle hook is enabled for the Auto Scaling group and a userdata executeds during instance startup. The userdata script installs an application if it's not installed and completes the lifecycle hook action. If the application is already installed, the userdata script starts the appliction and completes the lifecycle hook action. The userdata script is configured to execute during every instance startup, so bootstrap actions can complete when the instance is initially launched and when restarted from a stopped state. This example demonstrates how you could handle a scenario where multiple reboots were required to install and configure an application before bringing it into service.
